Included herein are the intermediary codes and final report for a kaggle competition where we try to predict Los Angeles Fire Department response times.  The competition and report made up the final project in Machine Learning class (Stats 101C) at University of California Los Angeles (Spring, 2017).  The competition and report were as much about using the machine learning libraries as they were about solving the problem to the best of our ability.  As I was the more tech-savvy person in my group, I did most of the programming.  I made models using Random Forests, Linear Models, and XGBoosted Trees.  I made one model using a neural net, but ended it early as I didnâ€™t have computation time to run it to completion.  Our XGB model was amongst the top models in the class and we were one of a few groups that had noticed the outlier problem by report time.
